    # The problem is that to be able to use go get, one needs to put
    # the repository in the $GOPATH. So for example if your gitlab domain
    # is gitlab.com, and that your repository is namespace/project, and
    # the default GOPATH being /go, then you'd need to have your
    # repository in /go/src/gitlab.com/namespace/project
    # Thus, making a symbolic link corrects this.
