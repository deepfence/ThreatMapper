# Jenkins example for Deepfence Vulnerability Mapper

This project demonstrates using Deepfence Vulnerability Mapper in Jenkins build pipeline.
After customer's image is built, Deepfence Vulnerability Mapper is run on the image and results are sent to Deepfence management console for further analysis.
There is also an option to fail the build in case number of vulnerabilities crosses given limit.

## Steps
- Ensure `deepfenceio/deepfence_package_scanner_ce:1.3.1` image is present in the vm where jenkins is installed.
```shell script
docker pull deepfenceio/deepfence_package_scanner_ce:1.3.1
```
### Scripted Pipeline
```
stage('Run Deepfence Vulnerability Mapper'){
    DeepfenceAgent = docker.image("deepfenceio/deepfence_package_scanner_ce:1.3.1")
    try {
        c = DeepfenceAgent.run("-it --net=host -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock", "-deepfence-key=${deepfence_key} -vulnerability-scan=true -output=table -mode=local -mgmt-console-url=${deepfence_mgmt_console_url} -source=${full_image_name} -fail-on-count=${fail_cve_count} -fail-on-critical-count=${fail_critical_cve_count} -fail-on-high-count=${fail_high_cve_count} -fail-on-medium-count=${fail_medium_cve_count} -fail-on-low-count=${fail_low_cve_count} -fail-on-score=${fail_cve_score} -mask-cve-ids='${mask_cve_ids}'")
        sh "docker logs -f ${c.id}"
        def out = sh script: "docker inspect ${c.id} --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}'", returnStdout: true
        sh "exit ${out}"
    } finally {
        c.stop()
    }
}
```
### Declarative Pipeline
```
stage('Run Deepfence Vulnerability Mapper'){
    steps {
        script {
            DeepfenceAgent = docker.image("deepfenceio/deepfence_package_scanner_ce:1.3.1")
            try {
                c = DeepfenceAgent.run("-it --net=host -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock", "-deepfence-key=${deepfence_key} -vulnerability-scan=true -output=table -mode=local -mgmt-console-url=${deepfence_mgmt_console_url} -source=${full_image_name} -fail-on-count=${fail_cve_count} -fail-on-critical-count=${fail_critical_cve_count} -fail-on-high-count=${fail_high_cve_count} -fail-on-medium-count=${fail_medium_cve_count} -fail-on-low-count=${fail_low_cve_count} -fail-on-score=${fail_cve_score} -mask-cve-ids='${mask_cve_ids}'")
                sh "docker logs -f ${c.id}"
                def out = sh script: "docker inspect ${c.id} --format='{{.State.ExitCode}}'", returnStdout: true
                sh "exit ${out}"
            } finally {
                c.stop()
            }
        }
    }
}
```
- Set `deepfence_mgmt_console_url`, `fail_cve_count` variables in Jenkinsfile
