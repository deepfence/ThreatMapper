    "documentation": "## Overview\n\nThe [General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)](https://gdpr-info.eu/) is a new European privacy law that became enforceable on May 25, 2018. The GDPR replaces the EU Data Protection Directive, also known as [Directive 95/46/EC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_Protection_Directive). It's intended to harmonize data protection laws throughout the European Union (EU) by applying a single data protection law that is binding throughout each member state.\n\nThe GDPR applies to all organizations that are established in the EU and to organizations, whether or not established in the EU, that process the personal data of EU data subjects in connection with either the offering of goods or services to data subjects in the EU or the monitoring of behavior that takes place within the EU. Personal data is any information that relates to an identified or identifiable natural person.",

Taking into account the state of the art, the cost of implementation and the nature, scope, context and purposes of processing as well as the risks of varying likelihood and severity for rights and freedoms of natural persons posed by the processing, the controller shall, both at the time of the determination of the means for processing and at the time of the processing itself, implement appropriate technical and organisational measures, such as pseudonymisation, which are designed to implement data-protection principles, such as data minimisation, in an effective manner and to integrate the necessary safeguards into the processing in order to meet the requirements of this Regulation and protect the rights of data subjects.\n\n2. The controller shall implement appropriate technical and organisational measures for ensuring that, by default, only personal data which are necessary for each specific purpose of the processing are processed. That obligation applies to the amount of personal data collected, the extent of their processing, the period of their storage and their accessibility. In particular, such measures shall ensure that by default personal data are not made accessible without the individual's intervention to an indefinite number of natural persons.\n\n3. An approved certification mechanism pursuant to [Article 42](https://www.privacy-regulation.eu/en/article-42-certification-GDPR.htm) may be used as an element to demonstrate compliance with the requirements set out in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this Article.",
