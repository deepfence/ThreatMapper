It's intended for use by service organizations (organizations that provide information systems as a service to other organizations) to issue validated reports of [internal controls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internal_control) over those information systems to the users of those services. The reports focus on controls grouped into five categories known as Trust Service Principles.\n",
