    \ microservice securing your container, kubernetes and cloud deployments. The\
    \ API abstracts away underlying infrastructure details like cloud provider, \n\
    container distros, container orchestrator and type of deployment. This is one\
    \ uniform API to manage and control security alerts, policies and response to\
    \ alerts for microservices running anywhere i.e. managed pure greenfield container\
    \ deployments or a mix of containers, VMs and serverless paradigms like AWS Fargate."
