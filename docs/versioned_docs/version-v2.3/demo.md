# Quickstart with the Demo Sandbox

To get a quick overview of the ThreatMapper UI and operational processes, you can access the Demo sandbox:

 * URL: https://threatmapper.deepfence.show/

 * Username: `community@deepfence.io`

 * Password: `mzHAmWa!89zRD$KMIZ@ot4SiO`

The credentials provide read-only access to a live ThreatMapper instance.  You can explore the application topology, initiate vulnerability and other scans, review results and inspect the configuration for scanning registries and configuring notifications.
