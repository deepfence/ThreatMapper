# Installing ThreatMapper

The ThreatMapper product consists of a Management Console, and multiple Sensor Agent containers and Cloud Scanner tasks that are deployed within your production platform(s).

The Management Console is deployed first. The Management console generates an API key and a URL which you will need when you install the Cloud Scanner tasks and Sensor Agent containers.

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```
