# Notifications

You can integrate ThreatMapper with a variety of notification services.  Any time a new vulnerability is detected (for example, during [CI](../operations/scanning-ci) or an [automated scan](../operations/scanning), ThreatMapper will submit the details to the configured notification services.

## Configuring Notification Services

The following notification services are among those supported by ThreatMapper:   

```mdx-code-block
import DocCardList from '@theme/DocCardList';
import {useCurrentSidebarCategory} from '@docusaurus/theme-common';

<DocCardList items={useCurrentSidebarCategory().items}/>
```

Check out the **Integrations** pages in the Management Console for a full list.
